Farida Faqiri's portfolio showcases my skills 
as a front-end developer. It includes an introduction, 
details about my background and education, certifications, 
and a selection of recent projects like a survey form,
 a tribute page, a technical documentation page, 
and a product landing page. Each project demonstrates 
her proficiency in HTML, CSS, and responsive design.
 The portfolio also provides
 contact information and links to her social media profiles.
